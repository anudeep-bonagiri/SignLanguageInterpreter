# ✋ Sign Language Interpreter (In Progress)

Welcome to the **Sign Language Interpreter** project!  
This tool uses **computer vision** and **machine learning** to recognize sign language gestures in real-time through a webcam and translate them into text and speech.

> **Note:** This project is still a **work in progress** — more features and improvements are coming soon!

---

## 🚀 Project Goals
- 🎯 Recognize basic American Sign Language (ASL) gestures.
- 🎯 Display the recognized sign as text on screen.
- 🎯 Convert recognized text to speech in real-time to assist communication.
- 🎯 Build a simple, user-friendly interface for live translation.

## 📋 How to Set Up
1. **Clone the repository**  
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/sign-language-interpreter.git
2. cd sign-language-interpreter
3. python3 -m venv env
   source env/bin/activate
4. pip install opencv-python mediapipe tensorflow pyttsx3 numpy
5. python test.py
